    "1. If you are lost, other people are lost, and your questions will help us all get less lost! Please ask away by typing in the chat. I'll periodically pause to answer questions that come up.\n",
    "2. Please keep yourself muted unless talking to help us all hear.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Versions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python and pandas are continuously updated, so it's important to know what version you need for your script to work. We are using the following versions for this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python version: 3.8+](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/)\n",
    "- [pandas version: 1.3.4+](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebook Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is being run on [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html) which is a open-source tool that lets you store and run Python code alongside text, images, and other types of documentation. You can download and run Jupyter Notebook on your own computer, but this instance is hosted on [binder](https://jupyter.org/binder), which allows us to run Python 3 scripts directly in a browser. This setup was chosen for its minimal setup and teaching possiblities, but you don't have to use Jupyter Notebook to use Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Python set-up**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to use Jupyter Notebook for your future Python projects, check out this [basic setup](https://gitlab.com/mjanowiecki/python-lessons-for-librarians/-/wikis/Setting-up-Python) using Anaconda and Atom. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using slightly altered data for this workshop from [Johns Hopkins University's Electronic Thesis and Dissertations](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/836). Please re-use respectfully.\n",
