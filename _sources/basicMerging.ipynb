    "### Writing the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look more closely at the `merge()` function. The first two parameters are the left and rights objects to merge; this is where we want to put our `DataFrames`. The next parameter is the `how` parameter, and this is where we indicate what type of merge we want (`\"left\"`, `\"right\"`, `\"inner\"`, or `\"outer\"`). We want `how=\"left\"` for this merge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to use the `on` parameter to tell the function what identifier (aka column) we want to merge on. We need to set this to `degree_grantor`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, lets set the suffixes. These are suffixes like `_x` and `_y` that are added to your column names if you have matching column names in your two`DataFrames`. So, if you have a `Name` column in `df_1` and a `Name` column in `df_2`, the merged `DataFrame` will have columns named `Name_x` and `Name_y`. I like to set these suffixes as `_1` and `_2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now let's create a new CSV with our merged data."
